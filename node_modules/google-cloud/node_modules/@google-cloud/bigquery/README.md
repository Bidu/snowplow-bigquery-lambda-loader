# @google-cloud/bigquery
> Google BigQuery Client Library for Node.js

*Looking for more Google APIs than just BigQuery? You might want to check out [`google-cloud`][google-cloud].*

```sh
$ npm install --save @google-cloud/bigquery
```
```js
var bigquery = require('@google-cloud/bigquery')({
  projectId: 'grape-spaceship-123',
  keyFilename: '/path/to/keyfile.json'
});

// Access an existing dataset and table.
var schoolsDataset = bigquery.dataset('schools');
var schoolsTable = schoolsDataset.table('schoolsData');

// Import data into a table.
schoolsTable.import('/local/file.json', function(err, job) {});

// Get results from a query job.
var job = bigquery.job('job-id');

// Use a callback.
job.getQueryResults(function(err, rows) {});

// Or get the same results as a readable stream.
job.getQueryResults().on('data', function(row) {});

// Promises are also supported by omitting callbacks.
job.getQueryResults().then(function(data) {
  var rows = data[0];
});

// It's also possible to integrate with third-party Promise libraries.
var bigquery = require('@google-cloud/bigquery')({
  promise: require('bluebird')
});
```


## Authentication

It's incredibly easy to get authenticated and start using Google's APIs. You can set your credentials on a global basis as well as on a per-API basis. See each individual API section below to see how you can auth on a per-API-basis. This is useful if you want to use different accounts for different Google Cloud services.

### On Google Compute Engine

If you are running this client on Google Compute Engine, we handle authentication for you with no configuration. You just need to make sure that when you [set up the GCE instance][gce-how-to], you add the correct scopes for the APIs you want to access.

``` js
// Authenticating on a global basis.
var projectId = process.env.GCLOUD_PROJECT; // E.g. 'grape-spaceship-123'

var bigQuery = require('@google-cloud/bigquery')({
  projectId: projectId
});

// ...you're good to go!
```

### Elsewhere

If you are not running this client on Google Compute Engine, you need a Google Developers service account. To create a service account:

1. Visit the [Google Developers Console][dev-console].
2. Create a new project or click on an existing project.
3. Navigate to  **APIs & auth** > **APIs section** and turn on the following APIs (you may need to enable billing in order to use these services):
  * BigQuery API
4. Navigate to **APIs & auth** >  **Credentials** and then:
  * If you want to use a new service account, click on **Create new Client ID** and select **Service account**. After the account is created, you will be prompted to download the JSON key file that the library uses to authenticate your requests.
  * If you want to generate a new key for an existing service account, click on **Generate new JSON key** and download the JSON key file.

``` js
var projectId = process.env.GCLOUD_PROJECT; // E.g. 'grape-spaceship-123'

var bigQuery = require('@google-cloud/bigquery')({
  projectId: projectId,

  // The path to your key file:
  keyFilename: '/path/to/keyfile.json'

  // Or the contents of the key file:
  credentials: require('./path/to/keyfile.json')
});

// ...you're good to go!
